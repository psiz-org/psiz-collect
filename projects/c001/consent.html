    <p><strong>Title of research study:</strong> Decisional Support for Human Visual Categorization</p>

    <p><strong>Investigator:</strong> Brett Roads</p>

    <h3>Why am I being invited to take part in a research study?</h3>
    <p>We invite you to take part in a research study because you are at least 18 years old, 
        have normal vision or wear corrective lenses, are a fluent English speaker and have 
        not previously participated in the experiment.</p>

    <h3>What should I know about a research study?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This research study will be explained to you.</li>
        <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
        <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
        <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
        <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
        <li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Who can I talk to?</h3>
    <p>If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you,
        talk to the research team by emailing Brett Roads at brett.roads@colorado.edu.</p>
    <p>This research has been reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board 
        ("IRB"). You may talk to them at (303) 735-3702 or irbadmin@colorado.edu if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your questions, concerns, or complaints are not being answered by the research team.</li>
        <li>You cannot reach the research team.</li>
        <li>You want to talk to someone besides the research team.</li>
        <li>You have questions about your rights as a research subject.</li>
        <li>You want to get information or provide input about this research.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why is this research being done?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this research is to determine the best way to provide supporting
        information to individuals performing a visual task. We are interested in 
        determining the type of information that enhances the accuracy of human 
        decisions. Knowledge gained from this research could lead to changes in the 
        design of software products that provide decisional support.</p>

    <h3>How long will the research last?</h3>
    <p>We expect that this research study will last for 2-3 years.</p>

    <h3>How many people will be studied?</h3>
    <p>We expect about 2000 people will be in this research study.</p>

    <h3>What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You will be using your own computer to complete the study at a time of your choosing.</li>
        <li>You will complete a series of visual tasks (i.e., trials) that will take a total of 10-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Each trial will require you to examine a set of images (e.g., rectangles, oriented lines, 
            birds, butterflies) and reach a decision based on similarity.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each set of images will contain one test image and a set of example images.</li>
            <li>Your task will be compare the test image to the set of example images and indicate 
            the similarity between the test image and example images.</li>
            <li>You should do this as quickly and accurately as you can.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Throughout the experiment, you will be notified of your progress.</li>
        <li>What you see on the screen will be manipulated as part of the study.</li>
        <li>We will only record your behavior on each trial (e.g., example selected, 
            response time) and your worker ID. No personally identifiable information will be collected.</li>       
    </ul>

    <h3>What happens if I do not want to be in this research?</h3>
    <p>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.</p>

    <h3>What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?</h3>
    <p>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. If 
        you choose to leave during the experiment, any data collected will be permanently deleted.</p>

    <h3>What happens to the information collected for the research?</h3>
    <p>Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of behavioral data 
        collected during this research study to people who have a need to review 
        this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that 
        may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other 
        representatives of this organization. In addition, representatives of 
        University of Colorado Boulder and the National Science Foundation may 
        inspect and copy this information.</p>
    <p>All data collected will be stored on a secure server indefinitely and 
        will only be accessible by the research team.</p>

    <h3>Can I be removed from the research without my OK?</h3>
    <p>The person in charge of the research study or the sponsor can remove you 
        from the research study without your approval. Possible reasons for 
        removal include the inability to follow study procedures.</p>

    <h3>What else do I need to know?</h3>
    <p>This research is being funded by the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center: 
        NSF grants SBE 0542013 and SMA 1041755 and NSF grant SES 1461535.</p>
    <p>If you agree to take part in this research study, we will pay you <strong>$1.00 for approximately 10
        minutes</strong> of your time and effort. This amount will not be pro-rated 
        for partial/incomplete participation.</p>
    <p>If you wish to learn more about the results of this research you can
